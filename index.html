            <p id="food-para">Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale and with a strong
                priority
                placed on "speed of service" versus other relevant factors involved in culinary science. Fast food was
                created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage
                workers who often did not have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait for their meal.
                By making the speed of service the priority, this ensured that customers with strictly limited time (a
                commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family, for example, or an hourly laborer on
                a short lunch break) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as is
                expected from a traditional "sit down" restaurant). In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an
                estimated $570 billion globally.[1]</p>

            <p> When food is ‘bae’, we can’t resist the eager to search for new recipes and gourmet other fellow foodies
                are into. Rather than turn to heavy cookbooks, many have turned to online blogs and their much-loved
                bloggers for those new casserole ideas and must-try Thanksgiving recipes.If you plan to become a food
                blogger I will help you get started. </p>

            <h4 id="font-weight">flower gardening</h4>
            <p>Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture. In gardens,
                ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such
                as root vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or
                for medicinal or cosmetic use.</p>
